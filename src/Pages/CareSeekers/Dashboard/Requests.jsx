    review: `The family was very organized with clear instructions for medications and routines, which made my job much easier. They were always respectful of my time and paid promptly. The only minor issue was that sometimes the adult children would change care schedules last minute, which made it a bit challenging to plan my week. I genuinely looked forward to each visit and felt like I was making a real difference in their daily lives. I would definitely recommend this family to other caregivers - they truly appreciate the work we do.`,
